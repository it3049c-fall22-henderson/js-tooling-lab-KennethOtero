## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 

I'd give myself 8/10 points on this lab. I had issues running cypress where it wouldn't create 
the integration folder, only fixtures and support. Since the integration folder and other tests weren't there, I wasn't really able to create a new test using Cypress referencing the auto-created ones. I instead manually created the folder (integration), file (username.test.js), and tests manually using Jest.

## Self-Reflection:
It's cool to see the different unit testing options available for JavaScript, and linting is a nice addition to help
clean things up as well.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me less than an hour in total to finish this lab.
